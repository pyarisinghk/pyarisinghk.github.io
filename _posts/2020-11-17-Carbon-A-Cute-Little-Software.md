title: Trying out Carbon 
---
I used to have this habit of writing quick reference notes during my college days and I am trying to do it for code these days. But my laziness stops me from doing that & I post these on my blog itself. For a change, thanks to my laziness. This time I am trying out something trendy and colorful instead of my regular cheat sheets:) [Carbon!](https://carbon.now.sh/) 

Below are some working snippets on list comprehensions, filters, maps & lambdas. Saving them here as screenshots from carbon. 
Do try out carbon if you haven’t tried it yet. Learning code is real fun with it. Especially if you are collaborating with someone in the learning process.

Lambdas in Python

List Comprehensions in Python

Maps in Python — With and Without Lambdas

Filters in Python
