title: Hello World! - From Github Pages

Hello World, 

I have been writing since Sept, 2009. I started blogging by jotting down my personal world views in my mother tongue, Malayalam. I gradually started writing on medium with my semi-technical blogs, which focussed on a bit of tech and more of techno-managerial stuffs. Those blogs were used as a medium of self expression the only targetted audience were probably my friends and my close circle and never made an attempt to promote them to the next level. 

I have been planning to write on pure tech alone and without any distractions. Moving to this platform is the first step in that direction and to focus more on technology. 

Thanking the Google India Scholarship, 2018 by Udacity for the inclusivity and the opportunity they gave to a woman of my age to help me take a baby step to come back to pure tech. 

Also, a big thanks to Barry Clark for [this](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/ "Barry Clark' post") post to make the transition to github pages super quick! Two days of reading (not continuous, ofcourse) and I am here, editing my first blog on Github pages)
