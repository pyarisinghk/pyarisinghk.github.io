title: Hello World! - Moving to a different platform
---

Hello World, 
I have been writing since Sept, 2009. I started with my personal world views in Malayalam. I slowly moved into medium with my semi technical blogs, which focussed on a bit of tech and more of techno managerial stuffs. 

It has been long since I have been planning to write on pure tech alone and without any distractions. Moving to this platform is the first step to write without distractions and to focus more on technology. 

Thanks to the Google India Scholarship, 2018 by Udacity for this change.
